After the birth of Tsamsara, magic has settled into the world's ecosystem, becoming a fact of life for its inhabitants just like the mountains and the sea. As landslides and freak waves occur, so do Anomalies.

Ranging from magnetic tides floating entire mountain ranges, winds made purely of thought, or graviturgical forces that invert buildings, Anomalies are manifestations of magic's ebb and flow

While severe Anomalies are rare, there are unconfirmed reports in the outland villages that they are increasing in frequency and magnitude.
