On F+534, High Warden Valynx declared the Shunde guilty of conspiracy to destabilize Benthia. The official story was that monks were discovered attempting to destabilize the crust which Benthia floats on, digging deep to cause the entire city to fall. However, rumors abound that the Headmaster Tiffany Pendeghast had fallen out of favor in the House of Concord and became obsessed with gaining power.

Regardless of the reason, the penalty was death and thus the Greycoats conducted their first purge. Having sustained heavy damage in the Armada's earlier invasion, the Kokkino district of Benthia was cordoned off to contain the fires. The cordon then became a Greycoat barricade to ensure no monks would escape. Led by Valynx, the main force advanced on the Monastery.

While the Shunde had centuries of experience fighting magic users, they were no match for the sheer numbers and martial talents of the Greycoats. Many were felled at Valynx's hand and he was responsible for ending four of the six original lines of the Shunde. The walls were breached in short order and the order was purged from the city.
