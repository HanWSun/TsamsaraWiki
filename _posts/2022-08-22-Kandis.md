Kandis Vanor has served on the SS Monday as the first mate/navigator from the very beginning. Though she does not talk much, Kandis' keen eye and loyaly to her crewmates have saved the ship from pirate attacks or freak Anomalies countless times. The musket she carries on her back is her pride and joy. She can usually be found in the crow's next with a bucket of stale bread, throwing loaves into the air for skeet shooting.
