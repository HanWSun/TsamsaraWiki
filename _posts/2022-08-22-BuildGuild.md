Established in F+249, the Build Guild are pioneers in the nascent field of Artificing; unearthing, studying, and re-engineering Old World artifacts. Thereâ€™s a guild hall in every major settlement and their headquarters is built into the side of Mt. Selunin, overlooking the city center of Isleheim. and some chapters in smaller towns. They welcome anyone with the desire to learn, but offerings of gold and Old World trinkets certainly won't hurt one's chances of admission.

Though the magic that powered the inner workings of the Old World's wondrous cities is long lost, the Guild's delvers and artificers have made significant headway into reviving what was lost. Given that the insides of any Old World device immediately disentegrates the second it is exposed to the outside world, Artificers replicate their function with careful application of magic where circuits once did the work. 

In addition, they often discover fragments of analog records left behind in the lost underground. Once these fragments are decoded and "sanitized" of potential trigger words by the Magician's Union, the Build Guild then disseminates this information to the world at large. It's thanks to the Build Guild that modern architects are able to build homes with reinforced concrete and glass.

The leadership structure of the Guild is fairly loose, each guild hall has a contingent of delvers and scholars devoted to exploration and study respectively. They are collectively known as "Artificers". Each hall has a head delver and head scholar; they occasionally report to the Master Explorers in Isleheim and share their findings and receive funding and equipment in return. Otherwise, each hall is free to operate as they see fit in pursuit of Old World knowledge.
