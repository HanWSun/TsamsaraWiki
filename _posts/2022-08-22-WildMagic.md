Magic is inherently a chaotic and primal force in Tsamsara. And trying to control it would be like trying to control the ocean. While great strides have been made to make practicing magic safe, there are cases where an individual gifted with magical talent or one who uncovers a forbidden Lost Text is unable to contain and control the arcane choas within them, and releases it in a destructive blast.

Wild Magic is reason why all texts suspected to be recovered from Old World archives or written too close to Foundation Day are heavily restricted by the metropolis leadership. By reading one of these "Lost Texts", it's possible for anyone to become a Wild Mage, effectively turning them into magical time bombs.

These surges of Wild Magic have a wide range of effects, most of them deadly to the source and anyone in their vicinity. While spontaneous Wild Magic surges are largely an urban myth, the fear of such a disaster is why many view people who openly practice magic with suspicion.

Archivists of the Shunde Monks posit Anomalies are Wild Magic surges on a larger, meteorological scale. Which does the repuatation of Wild Mages little good.
