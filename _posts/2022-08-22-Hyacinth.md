Hyacinth is the founder of Benthia's first rice farm, pioneering the techniques needed to harvest what would become the city's staple food. Thanks to their efforts, the once barren cliffs around the Benthic lake became arable farmland, allowing farmers and herbalist to safely harvest the crops that would be needed to sustain a metropolis. They were a natural choice for the House of Concord, in charge of Agricultural Affairs.

Despite their duties, Hyacinth prefers to stay outside the city walls, splitting time between the Verde Prasino district and their own farming compound on the Benthic Lakeshores. Aside from their farmers, Hyacinth is accompanied by Hallis, former representative for the Build Guild. The two of them have struck up a close relationship and can often be seen sneaking off together to the nearby cliffsides to watch the moon rise.
