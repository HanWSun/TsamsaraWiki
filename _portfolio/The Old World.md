Knowledge of the Old World is spotty at best, even with the combined efforts of scholars and archaeologists over the past 5 centuries. No one really knows what their society was like or even what the people even looked like.

Although Their lives are a mystery, Their legacy surrounds and permeates the land. Tsamsara's villages are cradled within fallen Old World mega-towers, artists recreate and reinterpret faded murals depicting long-gone heroes, and artificers have repurposed the rusted shells of  vehicles into horse-pulled carriages. It was even theorized They had magic far beyond modern understanding, with lost schools of "science" on tomes They called "computers".

Although many religions, schools of thought, and explorers have differing theories on how the people of the Old World disappeared, there are three facts everyone has agreed upon:
- They had wonders beyond imagination.
- They were all wiped out.
- They did not go quietly.
