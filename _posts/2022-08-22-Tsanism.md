Tsanism is the belief that the Land itself is sacred and alive. As children of the Land, Tsanists view the rains that water their fields and the animals that feed their families as gifts from the land. In return, it is the responsibility of all that partake in the Land's gifts to be respectful stewards of nature and ensure its continued prosperity.

Tsanism teaches that the world began with a single seedling sheltering a single spider that had survived the collapse of the world before. With these last two examples of flora and fauna, life was then able to start anew. While Tsanism remains an important part of people's lives in the outlands, it is not a formal religion and demands no tithe or creed outside of just existing without causing harm.

Clerics devoted to Tsanism often interpret certain elements of the land as thier domain of faith. Clerics of Peace have the cherry blossom as their source of divinity, whereas Tempest practitioners exemplify Tsamsara's storms. Primalism is an offshoot of Tsanism, interpreting the seedling as the driving factor of the Primal's decision to sacrifice itself.
