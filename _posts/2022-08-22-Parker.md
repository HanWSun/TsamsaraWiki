Although Kenku are born flightless, Captain Parker is at home in the skies. With over 20 years of flying and captaining airships, Parker says she's never lost a crewmmate or passenger in all her flights. Her tacit demeanor hides nerves of steel and although she never speaks louder than a whisper when not at the helm, her crew always listens when she speaks.

For a captain of her caliber, some fellow sailors have noted surprise at her accepting the captain's role for Barsield's personal air yacht. Most consider nobility as a cushy but boring job, consisting of ferrying the elite back and forth between their winter and summer home. Though Parker claims the slower pace suits her, the wistful look she has when staring at the slowly moving clouds implies otherwise.
