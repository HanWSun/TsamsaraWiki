Recovered from the ruins of Prospero's Town Hall by Niamh. The black box appears heavily damaged but is able to weakly display a moving picture along with a recorded sound.

The picture depicts High Warden Valynx speaking to someone off-scene. The person's voice seems familiar but unable to place.

- Valynx: "Give me our odds."
- Unknown: *"Of?"*
- "I have little patience for elaboration today, tell me whether or not more aggressive methods can be employed. Or will Freiya have her way?"
- *"Well, our people are very close to a majority in the House but unless either Brie or Hyacinth acquiesce, we are at an impass."*
- "Hyacinth sent in a vote in absentia, they vote no to whatever draft we submit."
- *"They have influence but with Atelayda and Tiffany out of the picture, they'll relent. Not nearly as much clout as they think they have. Anyways, Brie might be the better choice. Maybe get her brother to lean on her a bit?"*
- "She detests him."
- *"Most do. In anycase, Brie's the most likely to listen to what we have to say. Everyone has a price. With some letters, I can get Sibil and Freya to-"*
- "Enough. I'm sick of this political dance and having you and them preen about acting as you're above it all. Brie frequents the Underwalls, perfect spot for an accident. Arrange for your men to meet her there."
- *"I must say, that course of action is not something I would recommend."*
- "I would not recommend defying me so brazenly. If the rest of the House of Concord will not fall in line, they will be destroyed."
