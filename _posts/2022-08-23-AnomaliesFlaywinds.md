As many wizened travelers say, "You know you're in the Fallows when a Flaywind rips your head off".

A manifestation of Anomalies unique to the Fallows, Flaywinds are eldritch-charged gusts that can reach speeds enough to fell trees. However, what makes them truly dangerous is the tonnes of grit and sand the winds pick up, slashing the landscape with enough force to flense the flesh off any unlucky travelers.
