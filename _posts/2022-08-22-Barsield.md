Fat, jolly, and lazy, Barsield is the longest serving mayor of Jordis despite none of the citizens not really knowing what he does all day. Though by all accounts, he must be doing something as Jordis is currently enjoying a long period of moderate prosperity and safety. When he is not hosting feasts in his red-bricked mansion on the hill, he's often by the docks inspecting his brand-new airship or in the market park buying snacks.
