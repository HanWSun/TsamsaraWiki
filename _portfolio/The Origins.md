In a world as new as Tsamsara, there are many theories as to how the world came to be. For every 5 people, youâ€™ll have at least 8 opinions. 

Those in the outlands believe in the divinity of the land, of how life first emerged as seedlings borne of ghostly loam and rainwater. That is how Tsanism came to be. Others are Primalists, proposing a primordial Titan wandered the shell of the Old World and lamented the barren land. And thus he chose to sacrifice himself, to spark new life and let his bones form the foundation of Tsamsara.

Scholars and Artificers of the Magician's Union and the Build Guild posit variations on the theory of Tsamsarans being descendents of Old World survivors. Perhaps Tsamsarans are the lineage of long-dead explorers, who came from lands remote. Or even the skies above?

In any case, the New World is inextricably tied to the Old World, and perhaps through understanding how the last world died, it will be revealed how we came to be.
