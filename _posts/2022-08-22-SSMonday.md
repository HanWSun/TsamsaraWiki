Commissioned by Mayor Barsield of Jordis in F+533, the SS Monday is a state of the art, Luli-class airship. Boasting the ultimate in comfort and stability, the SS Monday is a stable ship perfect for the noble seeking to travel to and back from Benthia. While it's only lightly armed with 4 ballistae, it's robust engine and rigging means only a small, experienced crew is needed to fly it.

The ship is helmed by Captain Parker, with Kandis Vanor serving as navigator/first mate. Ardagio serves as the ship's physician and Pam Fallgor is the engineer responsible for the Arcane Core that keeps the ship aloft.

After a certain group of adventurers resolved the ferrobeast disturbance in the Kaspian Peaks for the town of Jordis, the SS Monday was (reluctantly) gifted to the four as a reward. The crew have since taken a liking to their new bosses and the SS Monday has faithfully taken the adventurers to Benthia and hopefully beyond.
