The man that would become High Warden Valynx lived as a prisoner in Benthia's Underwalls. After years of mining and excavating, removing tons of stone from Benthia's core amidst a permanent cloud of dust and dirt, he found his chance to escape when the cavern walls shook from the Armada's first barrage. With the Bluecoat guards panicking, he grabbed a pickaxe and led a revolution that saw the prisoners splitting their chains and swarming the streets to face the pirate invasion. 

Allegedly, Valynx climbed the mooring chain of the Armada's flagship and challenged the Captain of Captains, Anata to a duel. After an intense clash that saw the flagship sink and Anata tumbling to the sea below, Valynx allegedly leapt from ship to ship, slaying scores of pirates with nothing but his bare hands and pickaxe. 

After the counter attack, after every Armada airship was in ruins in the lake's EDZ, Valynx was hailed as a savior and his fellow prisoners dubbed the "Greycoats". He would rise to the House of Concord as High Warden of the Greycoat Guard and holds folkhero status among Benthia's populace. Valynx's face was allegedly scarred by Anata's last gunshot which is why he is never seen without his porcelain mask, permanently expressionless.
