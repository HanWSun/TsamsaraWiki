The conclave of Agaricales has stood proudly in the Fallows through centuries of famine and Anomaly. While the Anomalous Flay-winds shreds any plant that sets roots within the Fallows, the Druids of Agaricales have mastered the art of mycology and have used it to grow mushrooms that rival the size of any forest. Thanks to the work of countless Harbingers, Agaricales is shielded from anomalies and is entirely self-sufficient. The conclave itself is comprised of several "buildings" that dot a clearing among a copse of massive Wood Ears hollowed out for residents to make their homes. A massive Wood Ear reaches over the settlement itself like an umbrella, and many structures cling to its "trunk".

Although not every resident of Agaricales is a druid, all are in tune with the unique ecosystem found only in the Fallows. Mycology is a way of life, reinforced by philosophy/tradition of the Sacred Cycle. The Sacred Cycle happens yearly, allowing Agaricalans to honor the beauty of death and rebirth that fuels life in the region. When they feel like they are ready, aspiring druidic acolytes descend into the network of abandoned Old World rail tunnels and breath deeply of the spores that saturate the underground. Through a symbiotic process, the spores become a part of them and thier bodies become of the spores. They reemerge to their families, often adopting a new face, identity, or persona that reflects their soul.
