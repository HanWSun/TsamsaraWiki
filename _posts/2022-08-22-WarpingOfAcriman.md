On F+99, a freak Anomaly manifested two miles outside the village of Acriman. As the settlement was celebrating the turn of the century, the town guards were inebriated and thus unable to hear the tell-tale whoosing of a Graviturgical wave forming. The wave grew in scale and strength and eventually hit the event horizon upon which the forces folded in on each other and inverted. The inversion ripped its way across Arciman, forcing interiors of buildings outside and vice versa. It struck indiscriminantly and thus killed 430 out of 436 of its population. The only survivors were a group of friends who had ventured to a nearby hill to watch fireworks that would never come and a single guard who stumbled out of town to vomit.

News spread quickly and scholars flocked to Acriman to observe the aftermath as there has never been an Anomaly on such a destructive scale. Entire roads had been uprooted and the people standing on them forced underground to suffocate. The incident became known as the Warping of Acriman and was a critical driving point to the formation of the group that would become the Magician's Union. The few survivors were scarred by the loss of life and disgusted by the callous attitude of the scholars. They left Acriman and formed the Shunde, a monastic order dedicated to ending the terror of magic.
