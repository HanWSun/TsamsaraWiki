Denoted as F+0, Foundation Day is considered the day Tsamsara was born. Tsanism legend states amidst the still smoking ruins of the Old World, a survivor planted the first brick of the first hut that would become the first home in Tsamsara. The location of the actual first hut is up for debate and many villages each claim to be the site of the Foundational brick.

Nevertheless, the day is one of celebration and revelry, with drinking and the tradition of symbolically planting a brick in an empty lot to make a new home.
