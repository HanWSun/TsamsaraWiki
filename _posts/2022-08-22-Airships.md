A relatively recent invention, airships have become a rare but invaluable commodity for factions and settlements. Powered by an Arcane Core made from materials only found in Frigann, airships become lighter than air and catch the slipstreams with the grace of birds. Airship routes connect Benthia with its satellite villages in addition to linking the two metropolises. Due to their speed and ability to ignore terrain and waves, airships are used to transport high-priority parcels or VIPs. However, due to the rarity of Arcane Cores, airships are prohibitively expensive to own and operate.

After the failed invasion of Benthia, a motion was passed that prohibits any airship from carrying any weapons numbering over 4 and firing anything larger than a ballista bolt.
