Originating as an alternate interpretation of Tsanist beliefs, Primalism states the world of Tsamsara began after a Divine Beast known as the Primal sacrificed itself to seed new life on what was barren, fallow land. The following is an exerpt from veteran Pathos Idrick Forestsong's latest sermon in the Temenos dal Primalis.

"The story begins with the Primal wandering the collapsed world before, towering over desolate ocean basins and acres of dead trees. All while the dead sun cast the horizon in perpetual twilight. It is said the Primal strode the land for eons and eons, desperately seeking kindred spirits. Having found nothing but ruins, the Primal mourned the world before and lamented its passing.

After it mourned for one hundred nights, the Primal found a single seedling, cradled by rubble. Knowing it would never survive without water or sunlight, the Primal came to a realization: although life had ended, there is always the chance to start anew. As the Primal stared at the barren land, it began to cry, letting torrential tears fill up oceans and flow down rivers. It tore out vast swathes of wasteland, exposing fresh dirt underneath. The Primal then tore out his own teeth and planted them at their base to form magnificent mountain ranges, but left one tooth in his mouth. With all its might, the Primal let out a world-shaking roar, giving up its voice to startle the sun into waking up. 

With its energy spent, the Primal began to die. As its final breaths created the zephyrs that would carry seeds and birds, the Primal bit its own tongue with his last tooth, letting his blood nourish the soil and his soul to jumpstart Tsamsara as we know it."

While the story of the Primal cannot be confirmed to be factual, the legend has attracted many to Primalism, which teaches self-sacrifice to better the lives of those who would live after them. Most larger settlements, particularily ones near the metropolises, have a Primalist Temple open to all. While Primalism accepts people of all shapes and identities, it does occasionally clash with the Magician's Union and Build Guild, who have differing opinions on whether or not the Old World should stay in the past.

Each temple is headed by a Pathos, with the largest one being the Temenos dal Primalis in Benthia's Market District. It is tended by Pathos Idrick Forestsong, who has staunchly maintained the faith's neutrality and non-involvement in political affairs.
