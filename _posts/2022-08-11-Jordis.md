A small yet thriving community on the south coast of Benthic Lake, Jordis is the stepping off point for many travelers looking to get to Benthia. With its central position in Tsamsara, the village is rapidly becoming a hub for travel. Its fleet of sea and air-ships regularily sail the Benthic Lake and the Canyon Railway has its terminus stop just outside the village outskirts.

The Kaspian Peaks extend past the west of the village to the north, creating an imposing wall that shields the village from shrieking winds from the Founding Forest. Due to the Anomalies manifesting as magnetic tides in the region, Jordians are quite used to opening their curtains to see the Peaks floating miles above where they used to be.

Jordis has been led by Mayor Barsield for quite some time now. The seemingly ageless Tabaxi has enjoyed the longest tenure of any mayor with 36 years and while he keeps the life in the village relatively stable, some often wonder where their taxes go. The brand new air-yacht floating over his private dock happens to just be a gift.
