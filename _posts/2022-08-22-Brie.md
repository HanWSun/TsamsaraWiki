The newest member of the House of Concord, Brie Krisbin owned a humble stall in the Market district selling homemade helmets meant for Bompball. At the time, the sport was on the wane and she was unable to keep up with the fees to rent her spot in the market. Not to be deterred, she took what was left of her savings of 450 gold and put it in a prize pool for an underground revival of Bompball. Recruiting some of her stall mates, she distributed flyers and promoted the event in every tavern and store she could until it all came to a head with the inaugural Benthic Bash held in an abandoned Underwalls warehouse. Nearly half of Benthia was in attendence to watch 4 teams beat each other bloody with a quiche and Brie was able to save her market stall as well as those of her fellow stall owners. 

She was later offered a position in the House of Concord's recreation department and soon rose to the House of Concord's Representative of Parks and Recreation. She has a brother Camenber, who is also a House Representative in charge of Infrastructure. They don't talk much.
