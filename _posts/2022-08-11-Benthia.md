Floating miles above the Benthic Lake, scholars and mages have flocked to the floating landmass to research why it floats, setting the foundation for the metropolis.

Benthia is the premier place for the study of the phenomenon known as magic. You can find the headquarters of the Magician’s Union here as well as the Shunde Monastery, dedicated to exploring the depths.

The city is governed by a council of 10, representing the various guilds and aspects that drive life in the city. The members draw from the Magician’s Union, Build Guild, Shunde, as well as various departments normally found within a modern city/state.
