By his own admission, Hallis Kob is a grump. Former Head Delver of the Build Guild's Benthia chapter, he was ousted from leadership after a string of "disagreements" with city leadership (he claims their men swung first) and was replaced by his former student Sybil. She now holds his former position of Head Delver and representative of the Build Guild in the House of Concord.

Having taken this as his cue to retire, Hallis now spends his twilight years fishing in Hyacinth's farming compound. Although Hyacinth has on more than one occasion had to stop the Tortle from hucking explosvies into the lake out of frustration, the two have formed a close bond. Although he will never admit it, Hallis can often be caught smiling at Hyacinth when he thinks they're not looking. Proof that under his shell is a heart of gold.
