Once thought a myth, Ferrobeasts have become a frequent nuisance in the outlands of Tsamsara. Taking shapes of common wolves or large insects, they usually keep to themselves but often encroach on farmlands and steal away livestock or unwary farmers. 

Eyewitness accounts describe these abominable creatures as "half beast, half armor" given large portions of their bodies appear covered in Old World plating and wiring. It's rumored they were man-made and existed before Foundation Day though studying the beasts is quite difficult. The fact that  specimens immediately disintegrate upon capture or kill only reinforces their Old World connection.
