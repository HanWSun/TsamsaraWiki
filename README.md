This repo is for the a DnD campaign I am running for my friends. It's based on Jekyll and uses the Agency Themes by [Ravi Riley](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme)

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, clone this repo or your fork.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme.git
$ cd agency-jekyll-theme
```

Then run:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

To test the theme, run this. (Using the `--trace` flag for verbose errors.)

```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --trace
```

Then open your browser at:

- http://localhost:4000

Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the theme's contents. As you make modifications, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh. CSS changes will require a hard refresh.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
