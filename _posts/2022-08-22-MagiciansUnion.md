Since Foundation Day, Tsamsarans have found themselves terrified of the force known as magic that permeates this land. Between Anomalies and magical beasts roaming the land, the people have much to fear from magic. Thus, the Magician's Union was formed with the philosophy that to know magic is to tame it. Acting as both school and authority on Arcana, the Union accepts anyone with magical talent or the simple desire to learn.

A strong partner and collaborator with the Build Guild, the Union develops new spells to better life for people in Tsamsara or sanitize Old World records to make them safe for study. They are one of the few organizations authorized by the HoC to possess Old World records and information. The Union is composed of roughly 100 members in total, as those with magical talent are not common outside of druidic circles. Admission usually requires some type of magical trial administered by the Abyssans.

The hierarchy of the Magician's Union is as follows:
- Solsans: New students or initiates. Not all Solsans are students, others are magic users affiliated with the Union and pay to use the facilities.
- Damsans: Intermediate students, just starting to gain proficiency with magic. They are also granted reading privileges to some texts.
- Mitsans: Experts in magical theory and often selected to teach new Solsans.
- Abyssans: Masters of the magical craft and privy to all secrets of the Union.
- Hadalsan: The Headmaster of the Magician's Union and widely considered to be the most powerful mage alive.
- Archmage: A rank outside the hierarchy of the Union, granted to mages as a rank of esteemed honor for heroic magical contributions.

While their purpose is altruistic, in practice there have been incidents where the Magician's Union's discoveries have ultimately harmed the people of Tsamsara. 

A rogue Mitsan's of the Benthia campus illegally performed a "Geas" spell on a young child who witnessed him charm a shopkeeper for a discount. The spell ultimately malfunctioned and the child died. It was then decided that the Union's spells of the Enchantment and Illusions schools were far to dangerous to the autonomy of Tsamsara's people and thus its members banned from practising such magic. 

While efforts have been made to repair the Union's damaged reputation, the death of the child and the subsequent Visailin Pact have painted the organization in a negative light to many Tsamsarans.
