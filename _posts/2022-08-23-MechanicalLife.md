While much is left to learn about the race that lived before, scholars of the arcane and artifice know for a fact the Old World had mastered the art of creating life within a non-organic shell. A living machine. While efforts to recreate that ancient magic have always failed, someone seems to have cracked the code, with bio-mechanical beasts emerging from the ground and dragons clad in metal patrolling the skies above.

The possibility of mechanical life is a great source of debate within the ranks of Primalism, who believe that all life was born of the Primal's sacrifice. The idea of new life being created artificially for some of the members is an abomination. While discussion is ongoing, there are more than one occassion where a Pathos from a Primalist Temple was in a punch up with a Build Guild member.
