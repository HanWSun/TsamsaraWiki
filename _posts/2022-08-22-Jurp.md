Once a sleepy village built among the ruins of Old World suburbia, Jurp found itself suddenly beset by swarms of hyper-aggressive ferrobeasts. Attacking in the dead of night and taking villagers in their sleep, the villagers slowly gave up ground and retreated to city hall. The village is now a fraction of its original size as the inhabitants barricaded themselves behind hastily erected stake walls, manning Warding Gems that repel the ferrobeast incursions. The Warding Gems were a gift from a traveling wizard, who was unfortunately then kidnapped by the ferrobeasts soon after one night.

Things changed after a group of adventurers found themselves in Jurp. Tracing the source of the ferrobeast attacks to an abandoned Shunde monastery high above the mountain cliffs overlooking the village, the party slayed the Anata cult members creating the ferrobeasts and destroyed the facility. 

The village is led by Cara Malar, a woman who has to wear many hats now that all of her co workers are dead.
