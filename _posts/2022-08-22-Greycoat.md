Although Benthia has a reputation as one of the safest places to live in Tsamsara, its own history is not as spotless as the HoC would have people believe. The slums barely clinging to Benthia's lower cliffs used to house one of the largest prisons in the land. These prisoners were tasked with hollowing out the insides of the floating rock that supports the city; as the population increased, the rock underneath would need to be excavated to lighten the load. Once pure white, the prisoner's uniforms would be stained a slate grey after years of toil and dust.

When the Armada invaded, the Underwalls was spared the brunt of the attack and while the majority of the Bluecoat guard was being killed in the strets above, the prisoners rallied around a charismatic prisoner who led the great escape from the prison and successful counter attack on the Armada's flagship. This leader, later known as Valynx, would consolidate the prisoners into an effective militia that kept order while Benthia rebuilt. Achieving folk hero status, Valynx was elected to the House of Concord in charge of the new Greycoat guard, formed entirely of the former prisoners who saved the city.
