One of the many ways an Anomaly can manifest, Magnetic Tides fall on the more harmless side of the spectrum. These invisible ebbs and flows of raw magicka are charged with lightning, carrying an electric odor and exerting a strong force upon any metal object. For the most part, manifestations are gradual, rising slowly like the tide but can often catch people by surprise. While residents near the Benthic Lake are used to tying down their rakes and silverware, there is the occasional chainmail-clad traveler unprepared for the silent tide who is abruptly carried aloft like a leaf and carried high into the mountains. 

There are times when the flow becomes a deluge and Magnetic Tides are known to twist entire mountain peaks from their base, creating lines of titanic stone that residents pray will fall gently back to where they were.
