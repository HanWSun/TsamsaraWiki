Jurp's first line of defence from the sudden ferrobeast attacks, the Warding Gems catch moonlight and refract it in such a way that it burns the metal on each ferrobeast. They were an invention/gift of a traveling wizard Vardegan, who witnessed Jurp's plight and resolved to assist. By repurposing the Arcane Cores of derelict airships, Vardegan was able to generate an arcane current that powers the Gems and gives them their refractive qualities.
