The various religions, philosophies, and accumulated histories of Tsamsara each have their own theories on how the world came to be.
 
- Tsanism teaches the land recovered on its own after the Disaster that ended the Old World. To avoid the same fate, Tsanists place utmost respect on the land that nourishes and shelters them.
- Believers of Primalism that the world was borne from the sacrifice of the Divine Beast, who lamented the barren land and gave up his body to seed new life.
- The Druidic Conclaves of the Fallows say the land is in a constant state of flux, and each world has its time in the sun.  
- Scholars and Artificers of the Magician's Union and the Build Guild posit variations on the theory of Tsamsarans being descendents of Old World survivors.
 
While no one agrees on how Tsamsara came to be, they all agree on one thing. The Old World did not die out naturally. It was destroyed.
