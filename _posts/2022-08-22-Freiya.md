Youngest daughter and scion of the Izrafeldt clan, Freiya has been a fixture in Benthia's elite since her ascension to the House of Concord. The Izrafeldt clan are new money, rising to prominence after most of Benthia's upper crust was killed when the Armada breached the city walls. After leading rebuilding efforts and restructuring much of Benthia's governence, Freiya was responsible for consolidating authority under the House of Concord.

As representative of the HoC, Freiya heads the city's diplomatic affairs and frequently visits with her counterparts from Isleheim, New Acriman, and the Primal Fortress. Always dressed in poofy ballgowns regardless of weather, Freiya exudes an air of sophistication and immaculate style. She is never seen without her retinue of Greycoat guards. There are some who question the Izrafeldt's survival of the Invasion and subsequent success but those critics usually change their minds afterwards.
