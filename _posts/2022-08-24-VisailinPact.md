Ratified early in fifth century, the Visailin Pact was a binding agreement between Magician's Union, representing all magic practioners within Central Tsamsara, and the House of Concord, representing the citizens. The Pact was drafted after the death of an innocent child at the hands of a former member of the House of Concord.

A rogue Mitsan's of the Benthia campus illegally performed a "Geas" spell on a young child who witnessed him charm a shopkeeper for a discount. The spell ultimately malfunctioned and the child died. It was then decided that the Union's spells of the Enchantment and Illusions schools were far to dangerous to the autonomy of Tsamsara's people and thus its members banned from practising such magic. 

While there have been documented cases of improper magic usage by members of the Union, the death of Visailin was the tipping point. As the child of the then headmaster of the Shunde, Visailin's death nearly brought the Shunde and the Union to blows.
