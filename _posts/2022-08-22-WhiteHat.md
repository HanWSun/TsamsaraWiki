White Hat is a village on the edge of the Founding Forest. Known for little else other than it being the first stop for Armada sailors looking to enter the river route towards New Acriman, life in Acriman is simple and harsh. The region is known for its biting windstorms and being only a few kilometers away from the ruins of old Acriman, destroyed by a graviturgical Anomaly.
