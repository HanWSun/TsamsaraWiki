Youngest of three siblings, Ardagio is an experienced and faithful healer and scholar of the medical arts. Through his faith in the Primal, Ardagio is able to heal many wounds and ailments, landing him the position of Mayor Barsield's personal physician. Friendly and often fretful to his patients, Ardagio prides himself on his professionalism. Only Pam is able to find cracks in his bedside manner and the two are often on the verge of fisticuffs. Regardless, Ardagio is kind and compassionate to all his patients and often does enough worrying for all of them. Except for Pam.
