Isleheim is one of the two settlements in Tsamsara that has the honour of being called a "Metropolis". The massive city sprawls outwards from the epicenter of an ancient crater, digging a massive chunk from the nearby Selunin mountain range.

A great battle must have fought in the crater that the city now rests in, due to the numerous wrecks of buildings, roads, and what scholars theorize to be war machines that lay underneath the surface. It is due to this richness in Old World materials that the Build Guild found its home here.
