Roison is a sleepy village located in the south-eastern forests of Tsamsara. Known for its abundance of silk-spiders, the village houses many talented weavers and crafters of textiles. It commonly trades with the nearby metropolis of Isleheim who provides security along the dirt roads towards the city's crater.
