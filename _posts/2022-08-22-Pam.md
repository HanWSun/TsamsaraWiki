As a child, Pam Fallgar the 2nd grew up watching the sky. As her mothers were famed bird-keepers, Pam was instilled with a yearning to fly but also a weird urge to hit things with a hammer. Thus, she spent her teens devising wing suits modeled after the birds her family raised, collecting a fair number of scars and bruises along the way. 

When the first airship sailed over her village, she was enamored and immediately joined the Build Guild to learn how they worked. Eventually, she made her way to Jordis where she became the engineer responsible for keeping Mayor Barsield's new airship in working order. She treats her crew as her best friends and the ship's doctor Ardagio as her mortal enemy.
