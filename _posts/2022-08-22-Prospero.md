Situated on the western shore of the Benthic Lake, Prospero sits on the edge of the Lake's Ecological Dead Zone. As a result, most of its industry relies more on mining instead of fishing. Within the Kaspian Peaks lie veins of valuable iron and diamond, vital in medical magic. It was also said that veins of Jintahn were discovered deep underground, leading to a second boom in mining that could potentially break the monopoly the Armada has on the supply of the invaluable mineral.

The second boom was cut short however, when the town was destroyed by some unknown force that completely leveled the settlement. Survivors that made their way to Benthia claim seeing a massive twenty-foot figure flying above the town and unleashing a burst of energy that incinerated the town hall. They have been treated for fever and delirium commonly associated with exposure to Anomalies.
